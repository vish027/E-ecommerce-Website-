        Irrigation is a vital agricultural practice that involves supplying water to crops to help them grow optimally, especially in regions where rainfall is insufficient or irregular. By adopting efficient irrigation methods, farmers can enhance crop production, conserve water, and promote sustainable farming practices that protect the environment.
